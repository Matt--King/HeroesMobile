## A companion app to Heroes of the Storm

### Purpose and Key Features

Murky.GG is an application intended to be used along-side Blizzard’s MOBA Heroes of the

digestible way. It also provides an entertaining experience, especially in regards to the 

ubiquitous baby murloc, Murky, whose personality and visage can be found in all corners of 

the application. Finally, the application has a few unique features: MMR generation, custom 

icon generation, and closest-server optimization.  


Key Features:

* Survey on the user’s feelings towards Murky
* Personal notes on individual heroes
* Information about heroes, heroes’ power scaling, and battlegrounds
* Blizzard server locator
* MMR discovery 
* Custom hero league icon generator
* Being able to experience Murky outside of the Heroes of the Storm Nexus
